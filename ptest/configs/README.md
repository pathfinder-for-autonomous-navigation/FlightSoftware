# USB Console Configuration

Here you can find some template configurations. I recommend copy-pasting a template to somewhere else on your disk and updating it with real values. We don't want to upload actual configs to the repository since they contain sensitive data.

## Items
- `seed` : Randomization seed for simulation.
- `single_sat_sim`
  - If set to true, the MATLAB simulation expects there to be one device, `FlightController`, so that
    it can run a mission simulation on just one satellite.
  - If set to false, the MATLAB simulation expects there to be two devices, `FlightControllerLeader` and
    `FlightControllerFollower` to be defined, so that a full mission simulation may be carried out.
- `devices`: A list of device configuration objects, each with the following data:
  - `name` of device.
  - `run_mode`: Either set to `teensy` or `native`, depending on whether the device is connected via a Teensy or if the device should be emulated with a desktop binary.
  - `binary_filepath`: If the `run_mode` was specified as `native`, this filepath describes where to find the desktop binary. The filepath must be absolute.
- `radios`: A list of radio configuration objects, each with the following data:
  - `name` of device that the radio is connected to. It should correspond to one of the devices above.
  - `imei` IMEI # of the radio. This is used to tell Iridium which radio we're trying to collect/send data from/to.
  - `connect` If false, no attempt is made to establish the radio connection. This option exists so that the simulation can be run separately from radio testing.

All of the above fields are required, but the `devices` and `radios` list may potentially be empty.

# Config Keys Files

There are three config "keys" files in the config folder: `flask_keys.json`, `radio_keys.json`, and `server_keys.json`. All of these files contain confidential information, and should be in the gitignore file.

## Flask Keys

The Flask keys list the server and port on which the Flask server (`main.py` in the gsw folder) is running. These keys will be used in RadioSession to send a request for data from ElasticSearch.

{
    "server" : {server} ,
    "port": {port}
}

## Radio Keys

The radio keys contain the username and password for the PAN email account. They are used by the Flask server to read downlinks and uplink confirmations from Iridium.

{
   "email_username": {email},
   "email_password": {password}
}

## Server Keys

The Server keys list the server and port on which ElasticSearch is running. These keys are used by the Flask server to connect to, index information in, and request information from ElasticSearch.

{
    "server" : {server} ,
    "port": {port}
}
