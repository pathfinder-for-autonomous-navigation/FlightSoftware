/**
 * Uplink Consumer parses uplink packets received in its MT buffer. Expects
 * QuakeManager to set radio_mt_packet_fp to point to its MT buffer and expects
 * QuakeManager to set radio_mt_packet_len_fp whenever a new uplink is received. 
 * 
 * Dependencies: QuakeManager, StateFieldRegistry (must have access to this)
 * 
 * State Fields Provided: radio_mt_packet_fp, radio_mt_packet_len_fp
 * 
 * Notes: Since radio_mt_packet_f is a pointer to a buffer in QuakeManager,
 * if QuakeManager is destroyed/delete, this pointer will become invalid. 
 * QuakeManager must set radio_mt_packet_len_f to 0 before it dies. 
 * 
 * 
 * Protocol: A packet is parsed into a set of "requests". A request consists of
 * the index of a field in the registry and a new value to assign to that field. 
 * A request is invalid if the indicated field is not writable. 
 * A packet may consist of several requests. We will assume that new values are
 * padded such that they will be the same length as the field which they update. 
 * 
 * Example: 
 * Suppose we have this packet: [10][2][1][4]
 * 
 * It will have this binary representation: 
 * [_ _ _ _ _][_ _ _][_ _ _ _ _][_ _ _ _ _]
 * [0 1 0 1 0][0 1 0][0 0 0 0 1][0 0 1 0 0]
 * 
 * Uplink Consumer will interpret this packet as two requests:
 *      Update field 10 with the value 2
 *      Update field 1 with the value 4
 * 
 * Fields are indexed starting at 1. There is no field 0.
 * 
 * Notice that indices must be represented with the same number of bits. 
 * New values are assumed to be the same length as the field's value. If this 
 * packet is valid, we may assume that field 10 can be at most 7, and field 1 can
 * be at most 31.
