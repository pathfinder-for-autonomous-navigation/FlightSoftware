/** @brief Control task that estimates the spacecraft's attitude.
 *
 *  This control taks is essentially a wrapper around the attitude estimation
 *  algorithm provided by GNC (see gnc/attitude_estimator.hpp) that relies on
 *  inputs from the OrbitEstimator and ADCSBoxMonitor control tasks.
 *
 *  This control task itself can either be in one of two states: initialized or
 *  uninitialized.
 *
 *  In the initialized state, the filters state is "valid" and a filter update
 *  step cn succeed as long as time, position, magnetic field, and angular rate
 *  data is provided for a given control cycle (sun vector data is optional). If
 *  the data fails to be provided, the filter will fall back into an "invalid"
 *  state and must be reinitialized.
 *
 *  The filter is in an uninitialized state at startup. In this state, the control
 *  task will wait for time, position, magnetic field, and sun vector data to be
 *  provided. The filter will then attempt to initialize itself with that data. It
 *  is not guranteed to initialize (see the GNC documentation for more
 *  information).
 *
 *  The filter, when in the initialized state, will provide attitude, angular
 *  rate, and a state covariance criterion as outputs. If the filter is
 *  uninitialized, all estimation state fields will be set to NaN. */
