/**
 * PropulsionSystem class defines the interface for the propulsion system, which 
 * consists of an inner tank, Tank1, and the (outer) thrust tank, Tank2. 
 * This driver provides functionality for opening and closing valves on both tanks,
 * setting and enforcing the thrust schedule on Tank2
 * 
 * It consists of a static Tank1 (inner tank) and Tank2 (thrust tank) data objects. 
 * These data objects are "models" and represents the state of the tanks (i.e. which 
 * valves are open, the current tank pressure, the current temperature). 
 * Models do not change their own states. 
 * The "controller" is PropulsionSystem, which operates on the Tank models
 * in order to change their states. 
 *  
 * A schedule is a ordered list of four integers {0, 0, 0, 0} corresponding to the
 * four valves on Tank2. A schedule is "zero" if and only if all four integers are 0. 
 * It represents the duration for which we would like to open each valve. 
 * 
 * We say that the PropulsionSystem is "scheduled to fire" when Tank2 has a non-zero
 * schedule and interrupts are enabled. Tank2 is
 * "ready to fire" when it is "scheduled to fire" or is currently firing. 
 *  
 * This driver does not automatically disable interrupts once Tank2 is done firing. 
 * Therefore, we say that Tank2 is "done firing" when it has finished firing. 
 * This is indicated when its schedule is set to 0 (although interrupts may still be on).
 * 
 * Specifications:
 * Tank1 valves are at numbered 0, 1
 * Tank2 valves are at numbered 0, 1, 2, 3
 * we can open another valve. Tank1 10*1000 ms. Tank2 is 3ms
 * 
 * "enabled" means that the IntervalTimer (interrupts) for tank2 is on. This implies that:
 *      - either tank2 is "scheduled (to fire)" 
 *      - or tank2 has already fired
 * 
 * Dependencies: 
 * SpikeAndHold must be enabled in order to use this system
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Call setup to setup this device
 * - Use set_schedule to set a firing schedule for Tank2. 
 * - Use start_firing() to start firing Tank2
 * - Use clear_schedule() to reset the schedule
 * - Use is_firing() to check if Tank2 is currently firing
 * 
 * Implementation Notes and Warnings:
 * The only public methods that can change the states in tank1 or tank2 are the
 * methods in PropulsionSystem.
 * Prop controller is responsible for pressurizing tank1 before asking tank2 to fire
 * 
 * IntervalTimer (thrust_valve_loop_timer) enforces
 *  - tank2 3ms mandatory wait time
 *  - tank2 firing schedule
 * 
 * Only tank2 has a schedule since only tank2 uses the IntervalTimer to fire.
