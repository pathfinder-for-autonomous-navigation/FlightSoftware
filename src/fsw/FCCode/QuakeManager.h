 * Dependencies: ClockManager, Downlink Provider
 * 
 * States: config, wait, transceive, read, write.
 * 
 * All methods return true on success, false otherwise.
 *
 * 4/19/20:
 * - last_checkin_cycle_f is now only updated whenever we successfully get comms
 * - cycle_of_entry is the control cycle number at which the state machine entered its current state
 * - transceive now retries SBDIX as long as there is at least 1/3 of max_transceive_cycles number of cycles left
 * - initial state is radio_state_t::disabled and not radio_state_t::config
