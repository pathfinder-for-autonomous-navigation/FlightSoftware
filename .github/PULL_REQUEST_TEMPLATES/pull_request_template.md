## Summary of changes

### Testing
Such as your unit and functional testing. The testing should be at a level appropriate to demonstrate that your feature is sufficiently tested.
Post a HITL log if the test could affect HITL (i.e. major changes to subsystem controllers or to mission manager).
Post a HOOTL log if it helps support the claim that the master branch will remain unbroken.

If your update does not require significant testing, argue why.

### Constants
If your PR creates any constants, list them here and indicate whether or not you've added them to the recurring constants review.

### Documentation Evidence
Post to ReadTheDocs, or, argue that your inline documentation is sufficient.
